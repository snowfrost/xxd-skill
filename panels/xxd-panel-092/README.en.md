The eight works above comprise four 16:9 landscape left–right samples and four 3:4 portrait top–bottom samples. Every work was generated independently by Panel 092 from its own original brief; no artwork from another numbered Panel is reused. The samples use intelligent English copy.

## What it solves

A clean vector line erases gesture, while realist tracing overwhelms negative space and composition; Panel 092 reorganises the photograph's graphic relationships through loose contours and several kinds of hatching after deliberate reduction.

**Panel 092** preserves identity through loose yet accurate contour line drawing, then uses diagonal hatching, cross-hatching, and scribble hatching to shape shadows and structural turns. Free curves describe people, animals, plants, and objects; grouped diagonals and linear geometry organise tabletops, walls, floors, furniture, and shadow directions, holding looseness in tension with a stable framework.

### Best for

- strong black-and-white graphic impact, with dense hatched masses and broad negative shapes establishing hierarchy;
- a sense of observed speed and gesture, retaining quick, free, slightly rough lines, repeated corrections, and uneven density;
- tension between looseness and order, with free contours carrying organic subjects and geometric hatching stabilising the environment and composition;
- top-bottom, left-right, design-only, multi-ratio, wallpaper, and directory-batch delivery.

### Quick start

> Use XXD Panel 092 on this image and recommend the most suitable composition and size first.

## Quick fit check

| What you need to know | What this style gives you |
|---|---|
| **What you get** | An expressive pen-and-ink illustration combining observed speed, strong black-and-white graphics, and editorial composition |
| **Recognisable signature** | Loose contours, diagonal hatching, cross-hatching, scribble hatching, dark masses, and broad negative shapes |
| **How it respects the source** | It retains key identity and scene logic, actively simplifies complex backgrounds, then reorganises position, density, and rhythm |
| **Where it works** | Art posters, covers, social content, design-only art, multiple ratios, and four-device wallpaper sets |
<!-- xxd-panel-benefit:end -->

## Usage tips

- **Start with one clear photo:** choose a source whose subject, action, and relationships are easy to recognize before choosing the delivery format.
- **Join the parameters in one sentence:** say “top-bottom / left-right / design-only + 16:9 / 3:4 / phone wallpaper”; you can also name desktop, tablet, or smartwatch sizes.
- **State what must stay:** identify the people, objects, actions, relationships, and copy to preserve, while leaving room for the style to design the layout.
- **Choose a text mode:** let the model write from the image, lock exact wording with `--text exact --copy`, or remove text completely with `--text none`.
- **Clarify reality and design regions:** for top-bottom or left-right, say which region keeps the photograph and which region is redesigned; for design-only and wallpapers, say that the whole canvas is redesigned.
- **Test one image before batching:** confirm mode, ratio, text, and language on one source, then reuse the settings for a folder; change one variable per iteration.

## Get started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-092.git
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/xxd-panel-092" ~/.codex/skills/xxd-panel-092
```

You can also install it directly with `npx skills`:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-092 --skill xxd-panel-092
```

The command fetches the repository from GitHub and installs the same-named Skill for the current agent. To install it in the user-level Codex Skills directory, append `--global --agent codex --yes`.

Claude Code users may link the same folder under `~/.claude/skills/xxd-panel-092`. Restart the agent session after installation.

```text
$xxd-panel-092
Use this photograph, ask me for the modes and copy setting, then generate fresh raster outputs.
```

## The original brief is authoritative

`references/original-prompt/zh-CN.md` is this project's sole creative and aesthetic authority. The Skill no longer summarizes or expands it, and it does not impose a shared palette, colour plan, aesthetic motive, title, or microcopy package. GPT Image 2 follows that brief's own rules for colour, material, composition, whitespace, wording, and typography.

Mode and size completely replace the legacy 3:4 top-bottom delivery container without rewriting the transformation aesthetic. Each asset sends GPT Image 2 one selected mode's final contract instead of asking it to interpret four alternatives inside a generic template.

## Four combinable output modes

Select one or more of `top-bottom`, `left-right`, `design-only`, and `wallpaper-pack`. When several are selected, each is generated independently with its own prompt.

- `top-bottom`: one complete canvas with the reality view above and transformed design below.
- `left-right`: one complete canvas whose left-right structure runs from top edge to bottom edge, source left and design right. Typography stays inside that structure rather than creating a shared third footer; the outer regions are strictly 50:50; only each region’s internal crop, scale, whitespace and typography may vary.
- `design-only`: the source is a non-visible reference for identity, structure, colour logic, and facts; every visible element follows this Panel's transformation language.
- `wallpaper-pack`: each device receives an independently composed full-canvas transformed wallpaper, with no source-photo region.

There is no seam, midpoint-percentage, or pixel-coordinate test. Deterministic assembly is used only when the user explicitly requests exact panel geometry or pixel-identical source preservation.

Ordinary sizes are also multi-select: auto-fit, source aspect, 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 5:4, 2:3, 3:2, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9, 5:7, 7:5, or custom ratios/exact pixels. There is no silent default. Every distinct aspect is independently recomposed from the same verbatim source brief.

Wallpaper packs may be linked or independent. A linked pack creates one anchor image, then recomposes each remaining device from the original source plus that anchor; it never crops one image into four sizes.

Each invocation creates one task directory and writes every final PNG directly into it, with no source, mode, size, or device subfolders. Filenames include source order and a sanitized source name, for example `source-001-street-left-right-3x2-2160x1440.png` and `source-001-street-wallpaper-linked-phone-1440x3200.png`.

Pass an image directory directly to batch-process it with this same Soldier. Every discovered image keeps Panel 092's one original aesthetic. The Skill recursively inventories common raster formats, reports the count, resolves shared mode/size/text/locale settings once, and then generates each source independently without content or copy leaking between items. The whole batch still uses one flat task directory; an individual failure is recorded without silently dropping later images.

## Text modes

Before generation, resolve one of three choices:

1. **Model generates text from the original prompt**: the user supplies only the language or locale; GPT Image 2 follows the source brief's wording, amount, tone, and typography logic. Every word arises from the current image's content, atmosphere, or implied meaning, and anything presented as factual or documentary information must be grounded in supplied, visible, or verified facts.
2. **Use my exact text**: pass it verbatim, without rewriting, translating, or adding a title; typography still follows the source brief.
3. **No text**: prohibit visible text and pseudo-text.

The outer Skill no longer pre-writes titles, microcopy, or copy packages. Output language is resolved separately from the interface language and is never guessed from a person, scene, or filename.

## Complete-canvas first, raster-only delivery

The image model owns the aesthetics of the entire finished composition; paired layouts also default to one complete-canvas generation. `scripts/compose_panel.py` remains only for condition-based recovery, lossless pixel calibration, and read-only audit. It is not run pre-emptively and does not judge aesthetic success.

Every deliverable is a raster PNG and every invocation creates a fresh task under `~/Desktop/xxd/`. The configured image route exposes sanitised status only—never providers, endpoints, credentials, headers, prompts, responses, or account details. SVG, HTML, Canvas, diagrams, and programmatic drawing are not substitutes for the final artwork.

## Capability-adaptive questions and inline parameters

The same Skill adapts to the host's real interaction capabilities and never presents decorative symbols as clickable controls:

- **When Claude Code exposes `AskUserQuestion + multiSelect: true`**: modes and sizes use genuine checkboxes; text mode and wallpaper relationship use single-select. Common sizes are grouped into square, portrait, and landscape checkbox questions, selections accumulate across groups, and custom sizes use free input.
- **When Codex exposes only `request_user_input`**: use it only for mutually exclusive fields such as text mode and wallpaper relationship. Do not misrepresent modes or sizes as single-choice; collect them through clear combination input.
- **With no interactive question tool**: use two typed rounds—modes first, then sizes plus text. Never draw fake `- [ ]` boxes or ask the user to switch to Plan mode merely to obtain a form.

The second round initially shows only Smart recommendation, Source aspect, Common ratios, and Custom. Expand the full library only when requested: square `1:1`; portrait `3:4, 4:5, 2:3, 9:16, 5:7`; landscape `4:3, 5:4, 3:2, 16:9, 21:9, 7:5`. Any ratios may be combined, and exact pixels are always accepted.

All settings can also be passed inline:

```text
/xxd-panel-092 photo.jpg --mode top-bottom,design-only --size auto,3:4,9:16 --text prompt --locale ja-JP
```

Supported parameters are `--mode`, repeatable or comma-separated `--size`, `--text prompt|exact|none`, `--locale`, `--copy`, `--wallpaper linked|independent`, `--wallpaper-size`, `--out`, and `--prefs`. Complete parameters skip preflight; partial parameters trigger only missing questions.

### Reuse the last preference or start fresh

When a valid preference exists and this invocation still has unresolved delivery settings, the Skill summarises the previous modes, sizes, text and locale, wallpaper relationship, and output location, then offers three mutually exclusive choices: **Reuse**, **Reuse and edit**, or **Fresh configuration**. Explicit current requirements always win, and complete parameters still run without redundant questions.

Use `--prefs last|edit|new|off|clear` to choose the route inline:

```text
/xxd-panel-092 photo.jpg --prefs last
/xxd-panel-092 photo.jpg --prefs edit
/xxd-panel-092 photo.jpg --prefs new
```

The record stores delivery settings only. It never stores source images, exact copy, generated results, Panel choices, model routes, API credentials, or other sensitive information.

Replace `photo.jpg` with an image-directory path to enter batch processing automatically; no separate `--batch` switch is required.

### Parameter quick reference

| Parameter | Purpose | Common values or format |
|---|---|---|
| `--mode` | Select one or more deliverable types | `top-bottom`, `left-right`, `design-only`, `wallpaper-pack` |
| `--size` | Select ordinary-output ratios or exact pixels; accepts several | `auto`, `source`, `3:4`, `9:16`, `2160x3840` |
| `--text` | Choose the source of visible text | `prompt`, `exact`, `none` |
| `--locale` | Set the language or locale of visible text | `zh-CN`, `en-GB`, `ja-JP`, `ko-KR`, `ar-SA` |
| `--copy` | Pass user wording verbatim and imply `--text exact` | `--copy "Exact wording"` |
| `--wallpaper` | Set the relationship among four wallpapers | `linked`, `independent` |
| `--wallpaper-size` | Override pixel sizes by device | `phone=...`, `ipad=...`, `desktop=...`, `watch=...` |
| `--out` | Set an output root; a fresh task folder is still created | folder path |
| `--prefs` | Reuse, edit, replace, disable, or clear the last preference | `last`, `edit`, `new`, `off`, `clear` |

Replace `photo.jpg` with a local path, uploaded image, image directory, or another source explicitly supplied by the user. A directory enters batch processing automatically.

/xxd-panel-092 photo.jpg --mode top-bottom --mode left-right --size 3:4 --size 16:9 --text none --out ./deliveries
```

## Image-model priority

GPT Image 2 is the default first choice. It keeps this project's established workflow: high-fidelity source reference, explicit whole-canvas selection before generation, one complete-canvas generation for paired modes, and scripted composition only as a conditional fallback.

Seedance 5.0 Pro, Nano Banana Pro (Gemini Image Pro), Nano Banana 2 (Gemini Image Flash), or another compatible bitmap model may also be used when it is actually available through the current tools or configured routes and can satisfy source fidelity, whole-canvas ratio, target-language text, and linked-wallpaper multi-reference requirements. An alternative changes only the generation route; it must not change modes, canvas, copy, locale, wallpaper relationship, or the complete-canvas-first strategy.

If no suitable route is available, the Skill asks the user to enable an image-generation tool or provide an API key. User-provided credentials may be used for the current task without being echoed, displayed, logged, or exposed. They are not persisted, and provider, account, billing, or global route configuration is not modified, unless the user explicitly requests that configuration change.
