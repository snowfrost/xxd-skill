## Best-fit situations and problems solved

For personal photography collections, independent publications, exhibition studies and lifestyle visuals. A weak composition, busy background or small subject becomes a starting point for subtraction, rearrangement, cropping and scale changes—not a reason to apply a filter.

## Usage tips

- **Start with one clear photo:** choose a source whose subject, action, and relationships are easy to recognize before choosing the delivery format.
- **Join the parameters in one sentence:** say “top-bottom / left-right / design-only + 16:9 / 3:4 / phone wallpaper”; you can also name desktop, tablet, or smartwatch sizes.
- **State what must stay:** identify the people, objects, actions, relationships, and copy to preserve, while leaving room for the style to design the layout.
- **Choose a text mode:** let the model write from the image, lock exact wording with `--text exact --copy`, or remove text completely with `--text none`.
- **Clarify reality and design regions:** for top-bottom or left-right, say which region keeps the photograph and which region is redesigned; for design-only and wallpapers, say that the whole canvas is redesigned.
- **Test one image before batching:** confirm mode, ratio, text, and language on one source, then reuse the settings for a folder; change one variable per iteration.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-168.git
npx skills add https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-168 --skill xxd-panel-168
```

Restart the agent session after installation, then invoke `$xxd-panel-168`. Add `--global --agent codex --yes` when a user-level Codex installation is wanted.

Common examples:

```text
/xxd-panel-168 photo.jpg --mode top-bottom --size 3:4 --text prompt --locale en-US
/xxd-panel-168 photo.jpg --mode left-right --size 16:9 --text prompt --locale en-US
/xxd-panel-168 photo.jpg --mode design-only --size 9:16 --text none
/xxd-panel-168 ./photos --mode design-only --size auto,3:4 --text prompt --locale ja-JP
```

See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the full runtime contract and the [English](references/xxd-panel-168-prompt.en.md) or [Chinese](references/xxd-panel-168-prompt.zh-CN.md) runtime adapter.

## Original prompt

The [complete Chinese source](references/original-prompt/zh-CN.md) is preserved verbatim and is the sole creative and aesthetic authority at runtime. This batch provides five-language usage documentation, without four additional long-form translations. Style summaries are for discovery only and never replace the source.

## Quick fit check

Keep the source identity while redirecting composition; retain the material signature while actively leaving space. Choose exact text, generated copy or no text, with single-image or recursive directory processing and the four delivery modes below.

## Four output modes

- `top-bottom`: exactly two full-width regions, reality above and design below, 50% each.
- `left-right`: exactly two full-height regions, reality left and design right, 50% each; it never rotates into a top-bottom layout.
- `design-only`: the full canvas contains only Panel 168's designed translation; the photograph remains a non-visible reference.
- `wallpaper-pack`: creates complete artworks for phone, iPad, desktop, and watch, either `linked` as a coherent family or `independent` as four separate works.

Modes and sizes may be combined. Supported sizes include `1:1`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `4:5`, `5:4`, `2:3`, `3:2`, `9:16`, `16:9`, `21:9`, `5:7`, `7:5`, and exact pixels. Text can be prompt-generated, user-exact, or absent. A directory is inventoried recursively and every source is isolated while sharing one set of delivery settings; final PNG files remain flat in one fresh task directory.
