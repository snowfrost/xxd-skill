## 16:9 Left–Right Samples

Four independent sources on complete 16:9 canvases: reality left, this Panel's design right, exact 50:50. English copy is generated from each photograph.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="./assets/examples/sample-05.png" alt="XXD Panel 120 Sample 5"></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="./assets/examples/sample-06.png" alt="XXD Panel 120 Sample 6"></td>

    <td width="50%"><img src="./assets/examples/sample-08.png" alt="XXD Panel 120 Sample 8"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 3:4 Top–Bottom Samples

Four further independent sources, different from the 16:9 set, regenerated as complete 3:4 top–bottom canvases. The original photograph remains above; the lower design follows this Panel's original brief.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="./assets/examples/sample-09.png" alt="XXD Panel 120 additional top-bottom sample 1"></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="./assets/examples/sample-10.png" alt="XXD Panel 120 additional top-bottom sample 2"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="./assets/examples/sample-11.png" alt="XXD Panel 120 additional top-bottom sample 3"></td>
    <td width="50%"><img src="./assets/examples/sample-12.png" alt="XXD Panel 120 additional top-bottom sample 4"></td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Best-fit situations and problems solved

Want a concept drawing that communicates design exploration without tracing an entire photograph? Panel 120 preserves identity and spatial memory while distilling core forms, contours, and relationships into freehand perspective lines. Sparse colour, geometric guides, and extensive whitespace compose the result.

### Best for

- Turning architecture, spaces, travel, or object photography into editorial concept sketches.
- Rescuing weak composition, cluttered backgrounds, or small subjects through subtraction, rearrangement, and scale.
- Preserving recognition and spatial relationships without all-over colour or photorealistic rendering.
- Delivering a consistent style in paired layouts, design-only works, wallpapers, and directory batches.

### What it solves

- Removes background and secondary objects to preserve core forms and visual memory.
- Uses relaxed, restrained, slightly repeated perspective and construction lines to express design exploration.
- Makes whitespace an active part of composition instead of filling the page with decoration.
- Keeps comparisons to exactly two equal regions and generates each original independently without a second stylisation.

## Usage tips

- **Start with one clear photo:** choose a source whose subject, action, and relationships are easy to recognize before choosing the delivery format.
- **Join the parameters in one sentence:** say “top-bottom / left-right / design-only + 16:9 / 3:4 / phone wallpaper”; you can also name desktop, tablet, or smartwatch sizes.
- **State what must stay:** identify the people, objects, actions, relationships, and copy to preserve, while leaving room for the style to design the layout.
- **Choose a text mode:** let the model write from the image, lock exact wording with `--text exact --copy`, or remove text completely with `--text none`.
- **Clarify reality and design regions:** for top-bottom or left-right, say which region keeps the photograph and which region is redesigned; for design-only and wallpapers, say that the whole canvas is redesigned.
- **Test one image before batching:** confirm mode, ratio, text, and language on one source, then reuse the settings for a folder; change one variable per iteration.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-120.git
npx skills add https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-120 --skill xxd-panel-120
```

Restart the agent session after installation, then invoke `$xxd-panel-120`. Add `--global --agent codex --yes` when a user-level Codex installation is wanted.

Common examples:

```text
/xxd-panel-120 photo.jpg --mode top-bottom --size 3:4 --text prompt --locale en-US
/xxd-panel-120 photo.jpg --mode left-right --size 16:9 --text prompt --locale en-US
/xxd-panel-120 photo.jpg --mode design-only --size 9:16 --text none
/xxd-panel-120 ./photos --mode design-only --size auto,3:4 --text prompt --locale ja-JP
```

See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the full runtime contract and the [English](references/xxd-panel-120-prompt.en.md) or [Chinese](references/xxd-panel-120-prompt.zh-CN.md) runtime adapter.

The Chinese file preserves the user's source verbatim and is the sole runtime creative and aesthetic authority. The other versions are complete faithful reading translations.

## Four output modes

- `top-bottom`: exactly two full-width regions, reality above and design below, 50% each.
- `left-right`: exactly two full-height regions, reality left and design right, 50% each; it never rotates into a top-bottom layout.
- `design-only`: the full canvas contains only Panel 120's designed translation; the photograph remains a non-visible reference.
- `wallpaper-pack`: creates complete artworks for phone, iPad, desktop, and watch, either `linked` as a coherent family or `independent` as four separate works.

Modes and sizes may be combined. Supported sizes include `1:1`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `4:5`, `5:4`, `2:3`, `3:2`, `9:16`, `16:9`, `21:9`, `5:7`, `7:5`, and exact pixels. Text can be prompt-generated, user-exact, or absent. A directory is inventoried recursively and every source is isolated while sharing one set of delivery settings; final PNG files remain flat in one fresh task directory.
